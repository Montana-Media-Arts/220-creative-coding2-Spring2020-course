This is an important section because light can make or break how your video turns out. If it's too dark, you might not be able to see the subjects.  Also, if it's too bright, you might lose detail.  So, use light to your advantage which take experimentation.

What kinds of light are there?

1. Flat light
When you have your light source facing directly at the front of your subject, this is flat lighting. Flat lighting on a face will mean that your subject is well lit and you are unable to see any shadows along their face.
