# Unity User Interface

## Heirarchy

The first window is the hierarchy tab.  This window is where any added components to the scene appear.

## Project

The Project Tab is where all your assets appear.  Remember when you imported the assets from the store?  This tab contains all images, audio, prefabs, and other assets.  You access your assets here and drag them into the scene window.

## Scene

In the Scene window, this is like the design window.  It allows you to arrange items added to the scene before previewing it.

## Add an item to the scene

Let's add something to the scene.  Go into the Project section, and expand the Images folder.  Look for Spaceships and click on it.  Please select one of the Spaceships (Blue or Red) and drag it into the Scene.  You will see it in the Scene as well as in the Hierarchy.

## Does it run?

In the upper part of the window, click on the run button, and see if it works. You should see the background turn blue, and the ship appears.  Yes!  Not too exciting, though.

## Inspector

One more window that is important in Unity is the Inspector window.  The Inspector window is where we add components to our objects.

Now, let's move on so we can make the ship do something.
