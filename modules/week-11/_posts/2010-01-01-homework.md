In this homework, you are going to experiment and create a space game. Your main objective is to avoid the obstacles.  Your secondary goal is to collect all the collectibles before you run out of health.

* Add a background. It's up to you what you put on there.
* If you are hit, you should lose health.  If you run out of health, the game should be over.
* You should also have collectibles.  You are to create at least five obstacles, and they should either chase or patrol. Your choice!
* There should be at least five collectibles as well. 
* If you collect everything, you should win.
