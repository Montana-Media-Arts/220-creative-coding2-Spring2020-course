In this assignment, you are going to write a reflection paper on the circuit and code blocks that we covered this week. Additionally, you are going to create an artistic 3D model. You will need to turn in not only the .stl but also the .gcode file.
Technical specifications.

1.   Write a 1/2 to page summary on TinkerCadâ€™s circuit and code blocks.
2.   Create a 3D model and export it as a .stl file.
3.   Convert the .stl file into a .gcode file.
4.   Upload all files into your repository and turn in your link to your repository.
